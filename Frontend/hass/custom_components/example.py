~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example component to target an entity_id to:
 - turn it on at 7AM in the morning
 - turn it on if anyone comes home and it is off
 - turn it off if all lights are turned off
 - turn it off if all people leave the house
 - offer a service to turn it on for 10 seconds

Configuration:

To use the Example custom component you will need to add the following to
your configuration.yaml file.

example:
  target: TARGET_ENTITY

Variable:

target
*Required
TARGET_ENTITY should be one of your devices that can be turned on and off,
ie a light or a switch. Example value could be light.Ceiling or switch.AC
(if you have these devices with those names).
